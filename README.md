# 🌐 AetherNet: A Full-Stack Solana DePIN Project

AetherNet is a complete decentralized physical infrastructure network (DePIN) project built on the **Solana** blockchain. It showcases a full-stack, scalable architecture combining an **Anchor (Rust) smart contract**, a high-performance **Rust indexer and REST API**, and a modern **Next.js** frontend.

This repository serves as a comprehensive template for developers looking to build and deploy robust, real-world dApps on Solana.

## ✨ Features

* **On-Chain Node Registry:** Users can register and deregister their physical devices on the Solana blockchain.
* **SPL Token Staking:** Node registration requires staking a specific SPL token, which is returned upon deregistration.
* **High-Performance Indexer:** A background service built in Rust (`sqlx`, `tokio`) listens to on-chain accounts and syncs their state to a PostgreSQL database in near real-time.
* **REST API:** A scalable REST API built with Rust and **Axum** serves the indexed on-chain data to any client.
* **Reactive Frontend:** A modern dApp built with **Next.js**, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS provides a seamless user interface for wallet connection, node management, and viewing network stats.
* **Full User Lifecycle:** Complete flow for users to register, view their registered node, and deregister.
* **Scalable by Design:** The architecture separates on-chain logic from off-chain data querying, ensuring the UI remains fast and responsive, regardless of how many nodes are on the network.

## 🏗️ Project Architecture
AetherNet is designed with a scalable, multi-tiered architecture that separates on-chain logic from off-chain data services. This ensures that the user interface remains fast and responsive, regardless of the amount of data on the blockchain.

The system is composed of three core components: the Solana Program, the Indexer & API Service, and the Frontend dApp.

#  Solana Program (/programs/aethernet)
* Technology: Rust with the Anchor Framework.

* Responsibility: This is the on-chain heart of the application. It defines the core logic and the structure of the data accounts (NodeDevice, NetworkStats).

**Key Functions:**

* register_node: Creates a NodeDevice account for a user and stakes their SPL tokens.

* deregister_node: Closes the NodeDevice account and returns the staked tokens.

* initialize_network: Sets up the initial state for the network.

# Indexer & API Service (/indexer)
* Technology: Rust with Tokio, SQLx (for database), and Axum (for the API).

**Responsibility** 

* This service acts as the bridge between the on-chain world and the frontend, providing fast and efficient data access. It runs as two concurrent tasks:

* The Indexer: A background task that continuously polls the Solana blockchain for all accounts owned by our program. It deserializes the raw account data into a structured format and "upserts" it into a PostgreSQL database. This keeps the database in sync with the blockchain state.

* The REST API: An Axum web server that exposes endpoints (e.g., /nodes) for the frontend to query. Instead of hitting the blockchain directly for data, the frontend asks this API, which reads directly from the fast, indexed PostgreSQL database.

# Frontend dApp (/dapp)
* Technology: Next.js, React, TypeScript, and Solana Wallet Adapter.

* Responsibility: This is the user-facing application.

**Key Interactions**

* Reading Data: It fetches the list of all registered nodes by making a simple HTTP request to the Rust API (http://localhost:3000/nodes), ensuring the page loads instantly.

* Writing Data: When a user wants to perform an action that changes state (like registering or deregistering a node), it uses the connected wallet to build, sign, and send a transaction directly to the on-chain Solana program.
